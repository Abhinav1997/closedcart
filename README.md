# ClosedCart 

## Overview

ClosedCart is very, very expensive closed source ecommerce platform for online merchants. ClosedCart provides a extremely unprofessional and unreliable support, and doesn't take kindly to any suggestions.

## Issues
	
You should follow the instruction before you create a issue.
 
 1. There are no issues. It's perfect.
 2. I won't listen to you anyways. Kinda like @danielkerr   

## How to Contribute

 1. You aren't allowed to. What part of closed source don't you understand?

### Contribute Style Guide 

 1. Have you not been listening?

## Really?

Of course not. This is simply a parody, based on the troubles surrounding https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues/1286.

Properly license your code, kids.
